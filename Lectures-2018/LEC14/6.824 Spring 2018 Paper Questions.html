The parameter server model was developed for running machine-learning
algorithms like sparse logistic regression (§ 5.1).</p>
<p>What do you expect the bottleneck – that is, the most loaded –
resource (e.g., CPU, memory, network) to be at the <b>workers</b> and at
the <b>servers</b>?</p>

<!--<div class="questionbox" ID="q-ficus">
<p><a href="papers/ficus.pdf">Ficus</a>

Imagine a situation like the paper's Figure 1, but in which only Site
A updates file Foo. What should Ficus do in that case when the
partition is merged? Explain how Ficus could tell the difference
between the situation in which both Site A and Site B update Foo,
and the situation in which only Site A updates Foo.

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-spanner">
<p><a href="papers/spanner.pdf">Spanner</a>
Suppose a Spanner server's TT.now() returns correct
information, but the uncertainty is large. For example,
suppose the absolute time is 10:15:30, and TT.now()
returns the interval [10:15:20,10:15:40]. That interval
is correct in that it contains the absolute time, but the
error bound is 10 seconds.
See Section 3 for an explanation TT.now().
What bad effect will a large error bound have on Spanner's operation?
Give a specific example.
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-sundr">
<p>
<a href="papers/li-sundr.pdf">Secure Untrusted Data Repository (SUNDR)</a>
In the simple straw-man, both fetch and modify operations are placed
in the log and signed. Suppose an alternate design that only signs and
logs modify operations. Does this allow a malicious server to break
fetch-modify consistency or fork consistency? Why or why not?
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-ivy">
<p>
<a href="papers/li-dsm.pdf">Memory Coherence in Shared Virtual
Systems</a>. Answer this question using
<a href="notes/ivy-code.txt">ivy-code.txt</a>, which is a version of
the code in Section 3.1 with some clarifications and bug fixes. You
can see that the manager part of the WriteServer sends out invalidate
messages, and waits for confirmation messages indicating that the
invalidates have been received and processed. Suppose the manager sent
out invalidates, but did not wait for confirmations. Describe a
scenario in which lack of the confirmation would cause the system to
behave incorrectly. You should assume that the network delivers all
messages, and that none of the computers fail.

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-treadmarks">
<p>
<a href="papers/keleher-treadmarks.pdf">Distributed Shared Memory on
  Standard Workstations and Operating Systems</a>
Suppose that a simplified version of Treadmarks, called Dreadmarks,
simply sent all modifications of variables between an acquire and a
release to the next processor to acquire the same lock. No other
modifications are sent. What changes does Treadmarks send that
Dreadmarks does not?  Outline a specific simple situation in which
Treadmarks would provide more useful or intuitive memory behavior than
Dreadmarks.

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-munin">
<p>
<a href="papers/munin.pdf">Implementation and Performance of Munin</a> The SOR
application (see Section 4.2) with the producer-consumer pattern performs
substantial better than with the write-shared pattern (see Table 6 on page
161). Why is the producer-consumer pattern a better fit for SOR than write-shared?
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-harp">
<p>
<a href="papers/bliskov-harp.pdf">Replication in the Harp File System</a>
Figures 5-1, 5-2, and 5-3 show that Harp often finishes benchmarks
faster than a conventional non-replicated NFS server. This may be
surprising, since you might expect Harp to do strictly more work than a
conventional NFS server (for example, Harp must manage the replication).
Why is Harp often faster? Will all NFS operations be faster with Harp
than on a conventional NFS server, or just some of them? Which?

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-fds">
<p>
<a href="papers/fds.pdf">Flat Datacenter Storage</a> Suppose
tractserver T1 is temporarily unreachable due to a network problem, so
the metadata server drops T1 from the TLT.
Then the network problem goes away, but for a while the metadata
server is not aware that T1's status has changed. During this time
could T1 serve client
requests to read and write tracts that it stores? If yes, give an
example of how this could happen. If no, explain what mechanism(s)
prevent this from happening.

<a href="papers/paxos-simple.pdf">Paxos Made Simple</a>
Suppose that the acceptors are <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>,
and <i>C</i>. <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are also
proposers.
How does Paxos
ensure that the following sequence of events <u>can't</u> happen?
What actually happens, and which value is ultimately chosen?

<ol>
<li> <i>A</i> sends prepare requests with proposal number 1, and gets responses
  from <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>.
<li> <i>A</i> sends <tt><nobr>accept(1, "foo")</nobr></tt>
  to <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> and gets responses from both.
  Because a majority accepted, <i>A</i> thinks
  that <tt>"foo"</tt> has been chosen.
  However, <i>A</i> crashes before sending an <tt>accept</tt> to <i>B</i>.
<li><i>B</i> sends prepare messages with proposal number 2, and gets responses
  from <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.
<li><i>B</i> sends <tt><nobr>accept(2, "bar")</nobr></tt> messages
  to <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> and gets responses

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-hypervisor">
<p>
<a href="papers/bressoud-hypervisor.pdf">Hypervisor-based
  Fault-tolerance</a>
Suppose that instead of connecting both the primary and backup to the
same disk, we connected them to separate disks with identical copies
of the data? Would this work? What else might we have to worry about,
and what are some things that could go wrong?

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-wormhole">
<p><a href="papers/wormhole.pdf">Wormhole</a> stores the datamarker for
a multi-copy reliable delivery (MCRD) flow in Zookeeper, instead of in persistent

MCRD store the datamarker in Zookeeper?
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-fb-consistency">
<p><a href="papers/fb-consistency.pdf">Existential Consistency</a>.
Section 2.2 mentions that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_consistency">causal consistency</a>
is a non-local
consistency model, and thus can't be checked by the analysis
in Section 3. Give a pair of examples, one legal under causal
consistency and one illegal, that the Section 3 checker would
not be able to distinguish. That is, show by example that the
Section 3 approach can't check causal consistency.

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-borg">
  <p>
Borg's key benefit for Google is that it efficiently utilizes cluster
resources. As part of this, it is important to avoid resources being
wasted by sitting idle. List and describe at least <i>three</i> techniques
that Borg uses to ensure good machine and cluster utilization. What
potential negative consequences, if any, does each technique have for
(a) non-production/low-priority, and (b) production/high-priority workloads?

<a href="papers/kademlia.pdf">Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System
Based on the XOR Metric</a>
Consider a Kademlia-based key-value store with a million users, with non-mutable keys: once a
key is published, it will not be modified. The k/v store experiences a network partition into
two roughly equal partitions A and B for 1.5 hours.

<p>X is a very popular key. Would nodes in both A and B likely be able to
access X's value (1) during the partition? (2) 10 minutes after the network is joined?
(3) 25 hours after the network is joined?

<p>(optional) Would your answer change if X was an un-popular key?

In Figure 4, <tt>read_mail</tt> deletes email from the mailbox.  If
new mail arrives just before the delete, will the email be deleted but
not returned?  Please briefly explain your answer.
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-argus88">
<p>
<a href="papers/argus88.pdf">Distributed Programming in Argus</a>.
Starting at the bottom-left of page 310, the paper mentions that
a participant writes new versions to disk <b>twice</b>:
once before replying to a prepare message, and once after receiving
a commit message.
Why are both writes necessary?
What could go wrong if participants replied to the prepare
without writing the disk, instead only writing the disk
after receiving a commit message?
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-rstar">
<p>
<a href="papers/rstar.pdf">Transaction Management in the R* Distributed Database Management System</a>.
The first two paragraphs of Section 2.1 say that
a subordinate force-writes its disk <b>twice</b>:
once before replying to a PREPARE message, and once after receiving
a COMMIT message.
Why are both writes necessary?
What could go wrong if a subordinate replied to the PREPARE
without writing its disk, and only wrote its disk
after receiving a COMMIT message?
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-thor95">
<p>
<a href="papers/thor95.pdf">Efficient Optimisitic Concurrency Control
Using Loosely Synchronized Clocks</a>. The paper mentions
that, after a
server commits a transaction, the server sends out invalidation
messages to clients that are caching data written by that transaction. It
may take a while for those invalidations to arrive; during that time,
transactions at other clients may read stale cached data. How does Thor cope
with this situation?

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-plan9">
<p>
<a href="papers/plan9.pdf">Plan 9 from Bell Labs</a>
List three features introduced by Plan 9 that have not been adopted

Explain your answer.
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-remus">
<p>
The Remus paper's Figure 6 suggests that less frequent checkpoints can lead
to better performance. Of course, checkpointing only every X
milliseconds means that up to X milliseconds of work are lost if the
primary crashes. Suppose it was OK to lose an entire second of work if
the primary crashed. Explain why checkpointing every second would lead
to terrible performance if the application running on Remus were a Web
server.
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-epaxos">
<p>
When will an EPaxos replica <b>R</b> <em>execute</em> a particular
command <b>C</b>?  Think about when commands are committed, command
interference, read operations, etc.
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-bft">
<p>
Suppose that we eliminated the pre-prepare phase from the Practical
BFT protocol. Instead, the primary multicasts a PREPARE,v,n,m message
to the replicas, and the replicas multicast COMMIT messages and reply
to the client as before. What could go wrong with this protocol? Give
a short example, e.g., ``The primary sends foo, replicas 1 and 2 reply
with bar...''
</div>


<div class="questionbox" ID="q-txchains">
<p>
Give an example scenario where an application would behave incorrectly
if it waited for just the first hop in a chain to commit, but would
behave correctly by waiting for the entire chain to commit.
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-realworld">
<p>
Building distributed systems in the real world have both technical
challenges (e.g., dealing with bad data) and non-technical ones (e.g.,
how to structure a team). Which do you think is harder to get right? What
examples can you cite from your personal experience?
</div>

<div class="questionbox" ID="q-analogic">
<p>
<a href="papers/katabi-analogicfs.pdf">Experiences with a Distributed,
 Scalable, Methodological File System: AnalogicFS</a>. In many ways,
 this experiences paper raises more questions than it answers. Please
 answer one of the following questions, taking into consideration the
 rich history of AnalogicFS and the spirit in which the paper was
 written:

<p>
a) The analysis of A* search shown in Figure 1 claims to be an
introspective visualization of the AnalogicFS methodology; however,
not all decisions are depicted in the figure. In particular, if I
<= P, what should be the next node explored such that all assumptions
in Section 2 still hold? Show your work.

<p>
b) Despite the authors' claims in the introduction that AnalogicFS was
developed to study SCSI disks (and their interaction with lambda
calculus), the experimental setup detailed in Section 4.1 involves
decommissioned Gameboys instead, which use cartridge-based, Flash-like
memory. If the authors had used actual SCSI disks during the
experiments, how exactly might have their results changed
quantitatively?

<p>
c) AnalogicFS shows rather unstable multicast algorithm popularity
(Figure 5), especially compared with some of the previous systems
we've read about in 6.824. Give an example of another system that
would have a more steady measurement of popularity pages, especially
in the range of 0.1-0.4 decibels of bandwidth.

<p>
d) For his 6.824 project, Ben Bitdiddle chose to build a
variant of Lab 4
that faithfully emulates the constant expected seek time across
LISP machines, as AnalogicFS does. Upon implementation, however, he
immediately ran into the need to cap the value size to 400 nm, rather
than 676 nm. Explain what assumptions made for the AnalogicFS
implementation do not hold true for Lab 4, and why that changes the
maximum value size.
